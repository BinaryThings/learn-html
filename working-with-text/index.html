    <h1>Jimmy's blog</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage with readable content. In this page, 
      I will be going over the basics of inputting and organizing text.
    </p>
    <p>Text spacing will be compressed to no longer than a single
       space. Paragraph tags will be needed for separation otherwise 
       all text will be contained to a single large paragraph.
    </p>
    <!-- NEVER use <b> and <i> tags as they are only visual afffectations -->
    <p>The use of <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italics</em> are not 
      as simple as expected, as they indicate importance or emphasis 
      beyond the visual usage. This is important for screen readers
      for the visually impaired. Headers are similarly more than meets
      the eye, and dictate actual importance in a hierarchical way.
